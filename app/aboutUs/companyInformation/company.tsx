            G&V Support Services Limited was founded  by mr Gospel Akuetiemhe, driven by a passion for simplifying the complexities of expatriate relocation. 
            Recognizing the influx of global businesses into Nigeria, he saw an opportunity to create a service that would ease the transition for expatriates, ensuring they could focus on their professional roles while settling into a new environment.

        <p>Our first major project was supporting a group of  expatriate families relocating from korea to Nigeria, providing comprehensive destination services, including housing, school searches, and vehicle rentals.</p> 
            This successful project laid the foundation for G&V’s growth as a leading provider of expatriate support services in Nigeria.

            G&V is  evolved into a trusted name in expatriate services, expanding its footprint across Lagos, Abuja, Edo, Rivers, Imo, Delta, and Akwa Ibom States.

            Despite the challenges of operating in a rapidly evolving industry, G&V has remained committed to its core values and adaptable business strategies.  we have grown to become one of Nigeria’s leading independently run destination services providers, offering tailored solutions for multinational corporations and their expatriate employees.

            Initially focused on inbound relocation services, G&V expanded its offerings to include Visa and Immigration Services  to address the complex regulatory landscape in Nigeria. 
            <p>we also just  introduced our Car Rental and Lease Management Services, partnering with trusted providers to offer expatriates reliable, high-quality vehicles, from sleek sedans to spacious SUVs, tailored to their needs.</p> 

            Today, G&V Support Services Limited is a comprehensive expatriate solutions provider, delivering exceptional services that ensure smooth transitions for assignees across Nigeria’s key economic hubs.</div>
